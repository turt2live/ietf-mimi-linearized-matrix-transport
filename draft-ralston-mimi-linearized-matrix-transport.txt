1.  Introduction

   Linearized Matrix [I-D.ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix] (LM) focuses
   on the access control policies for a messaging protocol, but does not
   define a transport for client-to-server or server-to-server
   communications.  This document defines that transport, using gRPC
   (grpc.io (https://grpc.io/)) for server-to-server and describing the
   requirements of a client-to-server API without strict format.

   *TODO*: Is [I-D.kumar-rtgwg-grpc-protocol] up to date enough for a
   reference?

   Layering the transport in this way allows for messaging providers to
   use proprietary or otherwise custom transports when interacting with
   their servers.  The requirements of that API are described by this
   document, however.

   The types throughout this document form a single .proto file,
   included in the appendix for easy reference.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of [I-D.ralston-mimi-terminology].

3.  Architecture

   LM [I-D.ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix] defines a hub server and
   participant server which reside in the context of a room.  Each room
   has an MLS [RFC9420] group associated with it.  Each LM server is
   responsible for its own namespace of users (including clients of
   those users).

   The LM Transport protocol describes the requirements for a client to
   talk to its server, be it a hub or participant, and the baseline gRPC
   structures needed for a server to talk to another server.

   The server-server API has three logical operation modes:

   1.  Participant-to-hub for submitting events and information to the
       room.

   2.  Hub-to-participant for delivering messages from the room.

   3.  Direct-to-server when routing through a hub is inefficient or
       unnecessary.

   Additionally, the implied requirements of a client-server API are
   described, and where applicable guarantee that the sending client
   generated the request ultimately sent to another server.

   This diagram is simplified to show a single client per provider - a
   provider MAY have multiple clients and/or users.

   Servers (providers) are identified by their DNS name, as described in
   LM.

   *TODO*: Improve server name reference/bring section here?

4.  Client-Server API

   This document uses gRPC to describe client-server API operations, but
   does not require a server to use gRPC for such operations.  The
   client-server gRPC operations are purely for semantics.

   The operations here are inspired by Matrix's existing Client-Server
   API semantics as well as [I-D.robert-mimi-delivery-service] for MLS
   specifics.

4.1.  Operation: Create Room

   Clients MAY either request a room ID from their server prior to this
   operation, or if the server supports client-generated localparts the
   client can submit that instead.

   The room ID is used as the group ID for the MLS group.

   rpc CreateRoom(CreateRoomRequest) returns (CreateRoomResponse) {}

   message CreateRoomRequest {
     string room_id = 0;

     // TODO: MLS?
   }

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
